#+TITLE: Wiki

This is my personal wiki, served at [[https://wiki.jacob.chvatal.com]].
Daily thoughts are stored in journals/, while pages/ holds long-term notes.

The wiki's built with a tool I wrote and maintain, [[https://github.com/jakeisnt/wikigen][wikigen]].
Feel free to check it out and request any features you'd like - especially if you'd like to use the tool yourself!

This website has been inspired by the following:
- [[https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html][Devine Lu Linvega's Blog]]
- [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's Notes]]
- [[https://tomcritchlow.com/][Tom Critchlow's Site]]
- [[https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/][Nikita Voloboev's Gitbook]]

- [[https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/][Bruno Henriquez' Knowledge Base]]
- [[https://braindump.jethro.dev][Jethro's Braindump]]
and is in a state of continuous improvement.

I often use [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] to work on these notes, though my primary interface to them is through [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]].

This wiki is part of [[https://anagora.org][the agora]].
