#+TITLE: Wiki

This is my personal wiki, sometimes served at [[https://wiki.chvatal.com]].
Daily thoughts are stored in journals/, while pages/ holds long-term notes.

Note that hosting the wiki is a work in progress. I've decided to abandon
using Hugo's static site generator for my own system, but the system hasn't been 
finished yet. I'll get there someday : ' )

This website has been inspired by the following:
- [[https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html][Devine Lu Linvega's Blog]]
- [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's Notes]]
- [[https://tomcritchlow.com/][Tom Critchlow's Site]]
- [[https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/][Nikita Voloboev's Gitbook]]
- [[http://okmij.org/ftp/][Oleg's Notes]]
- [[https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/][Bruno Henriquez' Knowledge Base]]
- [[https://braindump.jethro.dev][Jethro's Braindump]]
and is in a state of continuous improvement.

I often use [[https://logseq.com][Logseq]] to work on these notes, though my primary interface to them is through [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]].

https://github.com/srid/rib-sample is a good reference for how to build a static site generator; look there for guidance. it's also built with nix which is good for examples!

the big problem here is how to sneak in javascript
