* TODO version control system that captures movements
- file system implementation that records all of the operations performed on a file over time
- editor that integrates with all of those changes and can easily visualize them
- somehow logged to a file
- perhaps converted to git or something?  this goes along with the 'file system' in memory editor idea i had before.
