editor to alias keywords while writing the language and automatically change them

for example:
    zig has var and not let, but i have javascript trauma regarding var, so i want to write let and swap to var onsave
    obviously this should be done per language, maybe some way to mechanize determining what can be rewritten?
    or just defining a standard library with a macro? zig might be able to do this?
