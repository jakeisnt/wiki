** 13:05 last day in ca
not much to do re quarantine, major sunburn, etc. trying to get some work done today but discipline is hard to find here - it's unclear what we would have done otherwise, too.

wondering how i can take better photos, or at least photos that feel the same way they come out on camera, but maybe even the best photographers just have good selection with their nature photography rather than getting every shot right out of camera. i've been afraid of editing photos because aside from the program seriously barring me and bricking on performance a little bit i'm not sure how to make sure i'm getting the magic i used to. i've been taking photos with my phone and honestly it is very good - maybe that much better.
