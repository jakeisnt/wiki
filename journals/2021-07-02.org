incredibly fun, almost nonsensical movie - i've never see nanything quite like it. feels like a quirky art film.
** 16:28 paterson
was brilliant - seen at ridwana's recommendation, genuinely one of the best movies i've ever seen. it's incredibly slow, contemplative, and without explicit conclusion - with beautiful frames throughout, and the progression of the story occuring implicitly as we watch the paterson navigate the world he lives in and his perspective changes, and continues to change, over time. there are lots of little details this movie has - and just as many that i wish it had, or felt were not ironed out well enough - but the ideas, the faith, and the execution are all there. really warned up to kylo ren for a minute.
