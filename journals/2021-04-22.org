- control of eating. make all of my own food, all the time.
- control of exercise. every morning, all the time. plan a specific regimen.
- control of schedule and other habits. not super strict on this one, as what i do differs from day to day, but i need some form of planning to ensure that i'm keeping consistent focus. 
- down to ~145 pounds. don't focus on the number, focus on personal appearance and health.
- be clean, consistent, on time and reliable - but not so reliable that you're always online. be reliable in person.
