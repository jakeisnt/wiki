<p>directly contact people you think are cool is one of the best things you can do for free on the internet i have gotten so much out of this and learned so much from it it's incredible, and i've barely scratched the surface of what is possible! DMs are a powerful force, they just have to be used effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>box time for social media interaction (outside of DM conversations)</li>
<li>be disciplined and polite when reaching out to others</li>
</ul></body></html>
