<p>i have been and need to build a system to move away from this system; plaintext just isn't cutting it anymore.</p>
<p>however, i need something to use practically daily to take notes, so this is that.</p>
<h3>recent tips</h3>
<dl>
<dt>posture</dt>
<dd>align the four cores: apple, chest, stomach, and pubic bone should all align to form a straight line.
</dd>
<dt>ask why someone feels good</dt>
<dd>not just when they say 'bad' to 'how are you' - we should be equally interested in their positive experiences!

<ul>
<li>post daily wraps: what did you do previously? what are you going to do tomorrow? just post sometime during the day!</li>
<li>minimize recurring meetings! we don't need a lot of them because they're distracting!</li>
<li>use one service as a central hub, and have automated status updating</li>
<li>discord: sync, super low resistance to hopping into other calls, tools or things; Linear: personal tast queue of tasks with definite acceptance criteria: imminent async; Notion: indefinite async and everything that has to do with long term documentation!</li>
</ul>
<h2>23:19 reward</h2>
<p>how to get into stimulants (concretely)? note: not healthy until my diet has stabilized!</p>
