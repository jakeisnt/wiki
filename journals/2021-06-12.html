<li>innovative with plastics and designs</li>
<li>cult following, but work faded in favor of philosophical, then consumerist minimalism, until present day - his curves and exotic shapes and colors didn't have a place until recent resurgeneces in 'maximalism' in design, or adding character</li>
<li>side note: I love how the state of the art in furniture and clothing design doesn't feel like it plateaus like it does with corporate UI/UX design. There is real room for innovation in actual consumer goods - unlike creative code and design where designs often live on as curiosities and go to die rather than filtering into mainstream practices and art as they do in clothing, furniture or similar places.</li>
<li>the sculpture sofas are incredible and worth poking around but they don't have much of a place today!</li>
