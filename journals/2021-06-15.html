<h3>demon slayer movie</h3>
<p>cute, kind of motivational, honestly not super well done. mostly inconsequential to the plot, i think, besides a couple of characters dying</p>
<h3>the tragedy of xx</h3>
<p>beautiful book - perhaps the best expression of emotion i've found in a novel. tragic and beautiful, at times echoes th documented dialogues of the greeks, worth revisiting again and again i think. motivates free will, admiring the small things, and nurturing emotions.</p>
<h3>househusband anime</h3>
<p>really fun watch and well done animation - framed almost like a comic. super short and easy to digest. fun to play with gender roles in that way.</p></body></html>
