<li>``There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds that people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot think.''</li>
<li>Shannon information theory?</li>
<li>Hired as a clerk for the computers of people like Feynman and Shannon. Kept asking 'why?'</li>
<li>you must first tell yourself that you'd like to do something significant</li>
<li>there is always repitition we see in people who make impacts, like Shannon. Partly luck but the only control we have over that is our circumstances</li>
<li>great work is not just 'brains'; often the issue is with articulation, a lack of an ability to access the language and forum necessary to develop ideas</li>
<li>once you've developed the courage to face - and solve - important problems, you can - he postulates that this will lead to a stream of successes if you stick to the method</li>
<li>the best stem work is often done early in the career while the best literary work is often done late</li>
<li>do not define your scale by the problems you've faced, Shannon error</li>
</ul>
<h1>Research times from @random<sub>walker</sub></h1>
<p>Knowing lots of things isn't important. What is important is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing what you know and don't.</li>
<li>Being good at teaching what you know.</li>
<li>Admitting when you're incorrect.</li>
<li>Communicating uncertainty effectively.</li>
<li>Spotting bullshit.</li>
<li>Recognizing others with expertise.</li>
<li>Recognizing different domains of expertise.</li>
<li>Recognizing different kinds of expertise.</li>
<li>Drawing from the expertise of others without deferring to authourity.</li>
<li>Accepting the unknowable. Abstractions exist for a reason!</li>
