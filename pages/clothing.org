My grandmother gave me her old machine, and being an ultralight- and recycle enthusiast, I set out to complete a backpack. The results is a 48L pack weighing in at 194 grams or 6.8 ounces. It is 100% made from recycled materials. - myog]]

"The reader must bear in mind that a traveller requires only that which is sufficient for travel and exploration; that a superfluity of goods or means will prove as fatal to him as poverty of supplies It is on this question of quality and quantity that the traveller has first to exercise his judgment and discretion."

-Henry M Stanley (from How I Found Livingston In Central Africa)
