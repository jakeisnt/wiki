#+TITLE: Macros
haskell doesnt work
macros involve evaluation: running program at compile time
requires running language inside compiler
places burden inside of language implementation to make life tricky
erlang vm has always supported continuously evaluating new code, unlike haskell, which has to have a very strange embedded interpreter to work properly! ghc templates might work better with better multi stage compilation?

macros in ruby are interesting: https://www.toptal.com/ruby/ruby-metaprogramming-cooler-than-it-sounds
