- Focus on what you have /accomplished/ and /can quantify/ rather than job responsibilities
- Include graduation date!
- Save resume as first and last name, not 'resume'
- Tailor the resume to match the job and add key words.
  idea: automate this?
- Always remember: a resume is for an interview, not a job. Just give them enough information to encourage them to interveiw you.
