<h1>Barcodes</h1>
<p>These are tempting, but it seems like it could be a bad idea to 'hardcode' a URL that might not function properly in the future – there's no good way for me to own a domain name without tying it to a specific product or service.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if I should spec into the blockchain URLs with arbitrary extensions now or in the future; those seem like the most reliable way to capture truly permanent links, so long as the heuristic is supported by major browser engines. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">Wikipedia's QR code guide</a>, with lots of quality information <a href="https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/Aztec">The Aztec barcode</a>, an alternative to the traditional one with supposedly just as much redundancy and a different look. <a href="https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/USPSIMPackage?data=9102805213683062522920">A nice utility for cloning barcodes.</a></p>
<h1>NFC Implants</h1>
<p>I'd like to eventually get one of these, but the capacity of storage is increasing incredibly rapidly, and the ability of these implants has not quite cut up. <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/">DangerousThings</a>, probably the best place now to purchase one of these implants. <a href="https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/magic-mifare-chips/6696">cloning mifare</a></p>
<h1>Tattoos</h1>
<p>kevin tattoos on instagram might be good but he does the same tattoo on everyone… i might want a tattoo for me instead</p></body></html>
