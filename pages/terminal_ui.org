A Terminal UI, or TUI, is a user interface that can be manipulated in the terminal, but that is not interacted with via shell commands.

Programs with a Terminal UI are written to function without the use of a graphical user interface, enabling easy access to desktop environments with tools such as SSH.

Some choose to use their system in an entirely TUI-based fashion with programs such as vim, mutt and tmux. Unfortunately, many websites and web-based programs are not usable without a graphical user interface,
