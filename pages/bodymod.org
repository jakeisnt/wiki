#+TITLE: Bodymod

Body modification and enhancement research with artificial tech (no drugs).

* Barcodes
These are tempting, but it seems like it could be a bad idea to 'hardcode' a URL that might not function properly in the future -- there's no good way for me to own a domain name without tying it to a specific product or service.

I'm wondering if I should spec into the blockchain URLs with arbitrary extensions now or in the future; those seem like the most reliable way to capture truly permanent links, so long as the heuristic is supported by major browser engines.
[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code][Wikipedia's QR code guide]], with lots of quality information
[[https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/Aztec][The Aztec barcode]], an alternative to the traditional one with supposedly just as much redundancy and a different look.

* NFC Implants
I'd like to eventually get one of these, but the capacity of storage is increasing incredibly rapidly, and the ability of these implants has not quite cut up.
[[https://dangerousthings.com/][DangerousThings]], probably the best place now to purchase one of these implants.

* Tattoos
kevin tattoos on instagram might be good but he does the same tattoo on everyone... i might want a tattoo for me instead
