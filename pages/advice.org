*** True Fans: Making Money from Internet Content
[[https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/][true fans: becoming popular on the internet]]
- To be a successful creator, all you need are a few thousand true fans.
- These fans will buy anything you produce and will support you directly.
- Aiming for 1,000 customers is much easier than aiming for a million passive fans!
- The most obscure node on the internet is only one click away from the next
  popular node; take advantage of this placement and make a living in
  obscurity.
- Now, small towns have the internet: a way to satiate the interests of those
  who would otherwise be isolated from their interests!
- Big corporations cannot deliver to these niche audiences and consumers! The
  creator has this unique market of niche fans who are willing to do a lot to
  enjoy their specific subculture.
- This path is another path to success: carve a niche, assemble a small
  community of fans, and continue to profit from the fans who are very
  passionate about your content and your niche as well.

[[https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/][true fans response: making something of yourself]]
- 1,000 true fans are too many! Really, you only need 100 true fans, each
  paying $1,000, rather than the 1,000 true fans as previously thought, as
  this is asserting for a future of the [[https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/][passion economy]].
- Cultivating a large, free audience, then converting some of those users to
  paying subscribers, and a subset of those to high-value purchases, will
  successfully cultivate a living wage.
- We are driven by autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The 100 true fans model
  feeds all of these for both consumers and producers -- by appeasing the
  ability for consumers to choose who to support and what to enjoy, enabling
  both consumers and producers to grow together, and giving both a niche
  purpose in which they can feel that they matter.
- Earning $1,000 per fan takes premium content with no substitutes,
  delivering tangible value, accountability, and status: progressing with
  further money.
- This essay asserts that fewer, truer fans are the key to successfully
  achieving financial stability.

** Dealing with Motivation: Jon Blow
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo][maanaging your own psychology, a potential barrier!]]

A variety of techniques for dealing with motivational issues!
We're likely unhappy for the majority of the time that we are unhappy in
front of the computer.

Be impervious as to whether ideas are true or false.

*** You are not your thoughts: Physical States
We think of our personalities as being composed of our thoughts.
However, this is a very small part of what it is like to be me.
Can be trapped in thoughts: these thoughts feel hard to get away from.
Before this, stand apart from your thoughts; distance yourself from them.
Focus on what you see.
Have some simple, sentence-style thoughts. Think of things that are
completely emotionally uncharged; thoughts that do not connect to strong
ideas.
Do not sink completely into the thought.
Realize that your thoughts change as you take in different parts of your
environment. Most of your experience is not comprised by this thought.

Step back from the thoughts that are happening. Do not be so enraptured by
them.

Prod some of these thoughts: how long does it take for the thoughts to go by?
How heavy is the thought?
Can you stop that thought and let it go or is there something that happens
when you try to do that?

Focus your attention on a single thought. Close your eyes. What do you feel
about it? Is this a solid object or ethereal? Is it well-defined or is it
indistinct?

By dropping your intention in, you are able to feel past your layer of
intention and analyze what has not been processed.

Do not have an agenda when inquiring about this sensation. Learn more about
the sensation.

The actual sensation is neutral; it is your interpretation of the situation
that is making it negative. It's very important to realize this.

Blow evaluates a particularly painful experience -- food poisoning -- and how
he can separate his understanding of the pain and their reaction to it.

We know this about pain! When we are cut, the nerve receives an impulse and
this impulse is recieved by the brain, which assigns negative sentiment to
these things.

Look at the sensations that help you generate this negative state.

There is probably some legitimage precedence for having developed a habit, or
a response; at some point, though, we must acknowledge that these processes
are not inherently necessary! We can then properly evaluate and control
whether we make decisions based on this state.

Always pinpoint the source of your emotions, whether positive or negative.
You are not your thoughts. Your thoughts are very small.
Step back.
Sensations are neutral. Your mind amplifies the sensations.
Try evaluating negative exercises as neutral experiences.

*** The Lesson TO Unlearn
[[http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html][paul graham]]
The most damaging thing you learned in school was to get good grades.
Do not mistake genuine interest for proficiency and measurement of learning.
You should not have to prepare for a test; they should reflect your
knowledge.

Tests are hackable!

It isn't that complicated! There is no complex game.
Identify a need, make your product very good, and it'll be popular.

Getting lots of users! People will recommend the product to their friends!

The way to win is not to hack the test. Don't face an artificial test! Make
people want to use your product!

He avoided working for big companies because you win at these big companies
for hacking bad tests.

Tests that aren't imposed by authourities, after all, are unhackable! There
is no trick or mindset behind taking advantage of them; they're moving
targets with lo clear answers.

You don't have to play the game! You can make it by *doing good work*.
*** Do Things That Don't Scale
[[http://paulgraham.com/ds.html][article]]
Startups don't take off by themselves -- the founders make them take off.

By yourself:
1. Recruit users manually.
   To grow your business naturally, you need to recruit! Aggresively!
   Shyness and laziness prevent people from doing this; wanting to write code
   and seeing the small numbers of users. Those initial users are necessary
   for exponential growth!
2. Get used to fragility. It's hard to balance a successful business, and
   squeezing the margins will make hte difference between success and failure.
   All startups are fragile! New startups can't be judged by the standards of
   successful ones.
   It's okay to get things wrong. It's okay to fix things.
   It's hard to see where you're coming from.
3. Delight. Don't just get users, make them happy! Make users know that
   signing up with you is the best thing they could have done. Try too hard
   to make your customers happy.
4. Experience. The user experience and quality of execution should be
   incredible. The product doesn't have to be great, but the experience of
   being a user does. Over-engage with initial users, listen to them
   carefully and pay close attention to their opinions.
5. Fire. Focus on a deliberately narrow market at first, then widen your
   breadth. Start with a subset of the market then quickly expand.
6. Consult. Pick a single, initial user and use them as a mold for a user to
   please. Recruit initial lukewarm users by using your software on their behalf
   and perfect the user experience and theri end.
7. Manual. You are your software. Do everything manually, then automate it
   later! This enables a faster launch, and automating out of this loop becomes
   trivial.
8. Big. Don't do the big launch! Nobody remembers it! Need something
   unscalably laborious.

*** Satisfaction in Work
**** Deep Work: Jon Blow
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej_3NKA3pk&app=desktop][talk]]
Though all software feels different, at the root of it all this all feels the
same.
The ideas you initially have will not be that deep; as such, the exciting
things are at the surface level. First, understand the single exciting idea
and explore it.
Initial actions primarily focus on working with the surface-level code;
determine how to navigate the code, working with code at a top level. We need
to focus on learning how to communicate to the computer!

Experienced programmers do not think about text; text is the application of a
drawn-out idea and a developed solution. A problem is decomposed into
smaller, tractale problems, then these tractable problems can be translated
into code that has been approached before.

The shape doesn't start anywhere! After having an idea, yo also need to
locate this starting point; from this starting point, you must then locate a
way from which you can navigate through the idea from this point. Not finding
the starting point is bad, worse than choosing the wrong starting point!

Some moments of programming involve internalizing a task so far that it's
been practiced; after performing this task so many times, you become
accustomed to translating this task into code without thinking about it! This
experience is incredibly powerful!

This is more like an art than an engineering -- you are following an
intuition, and this intuition carries you somewhere good!

Often, we get trapped by our attention: if we are deeply focused on a single
way of thinking and operating at a level of abstraction, we are unable to
switch contexts to another layer of abstraction very easily! Often it's best
to back up and reevaluate the big picture.

Getting to the deep work comes from experience. You'll follow many misguided
paths and many ill-guided directions, but at the end of the day you will
reach a deeper understanding of the topic at hand.

*** Philosophy in Life
[[https://hoanhan101.github.io/2020/04/26/guide-to-the-good-life][finding the good life]]
According to stoicism, the good life is:
**** The Good Life
- Virtuous: depending on how well one can perform the function for which they
  are dedicated
- Negative visualization: the fear that bad things will eventually happy
  isn't healthy!
  Forestall the adaptation process; stop taking things for granted and desire
  what we already have, craving to make the most of our crrent system, our
  current time and our current situation. It would be best to take advantage
  of opportunities for moving forward, but before making these decisions it
  is most important to establish contentedness.
**** Taking Control
- We have control over our goals, but do not have complete or any control
  over many events. We must learn to welcome what happens to us and trust
  that this occurs for the best.
- Willpower is like muscle power. The more we exercise our willpower, the
  more self-control we have over ourselves; the more self-control we have,
  the better we are able to direct our lives.
- It's important to reflect on your process.
  What are you spending time on?
  How did we feel over the course of the day?
  Did something disrupt our tranquility?
  Did we experience adverse feelings?
  Is there something I could avoid?
  Is there some action I could take to become more productive?
**** Daily Living
- We are rewarded for working and interacting with other people in ways that
  are advantageous.
- We must operate on teh assumption that annoying people are fated to behave
  this way, and that this behavior is inevitable.
- Insult:
  The things themselves do not upset us, but rather our judgements about
  these things.
  - When insulted, evaluate the insult rather than the individual and reserve
    a judgement made about this thing.

*** The Happiness Hypothesis
[[https://hoanhan101.github.io/2020/05/10/happiness-hypothesis][article]]
- Happiness is a combination of biological initial happiness, life conditions
  and voluntary activities. The challenge here is to understand your initial
  happiness, pushing the life conditions and the voluntary activities to make
  the most enjoyment of the happiness.
- To love well is to develop good relationships with others.
- Once basic needs are met, money cannot buy additional happiness.
- Luxuries adapt to what we require for ourselves; impure luxuries can enable
  us to spend more time with family, reduce commute and take longer
  vacations; these are the luxuries we should strive for.
- Things we choose to do should be things that fall to our strength.
- Progress principle: pleasure comes from making progress towards a goal
  rather than achieving it.

**** Unlimited Memory
[[https://hoanhan101.github.io/2020/04/14/unlimited-memory][article]]
Concentrate. Do one thing at a time! Exceptional work is associated with
periods of deep concentration and focus.
Always have a clear purpose. Why does it matter? How is it applicabl to my
life? How can it help me achieve my goals?
Apply creativity to everything you learn! Make learning more fun, engage more
senses, and grant actions to images.
Long-term memory can trap short-term information:
- Car method: use the car and store new information in parts of the car
- Peg method: use rhyming words to store ordered information
- Developing a storyline: create a relationship between the known and the
  unknown, raising the memory capacity!
Continuous use. continue to review, have a clear purpose, and make this a
part of your daily routine!

*** Learning to Think Better
[[https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-to-think-better/answer/Alan-Kay-11?share=1][src]]
We are most well set up for learning to fit into our cultures and navigate
them socially.
We are often not able to think well enough to see that we are not thinking
well enough! This is the Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's known that we can only deal with a small number of things at once; we
must limit the input we receive and focus only on the core idea at hand.

"You can't thinking about thinking without thinking about something." -
Seymour Papert. It will help to have issues and ideas, things to learn about
that require better procedures; then, navigating those procedures assist you
in developing better thinking procedures!


* being human by being animal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG058g3f8Ik&app=desktop
removing animals of nay dignified cuteness; bojack horseman is pretty close
to this uncanny valley of creepy absurdism. the desire is not to make the
animals cute so much as lifelike and uncomfortable.

bojack as a horse ::  horse, long face, depression, juxtaposition of a
majestic animal as an alcoholic, etc. horse bredfor transportation but the
role no longer fulfulls the animal; could come from some broader interest in
horses
the main characters are drawn from domestic animals !
four legs good . two legs better . the control we have over domestic animals
is associated with the characters chosen for the show .

pushing the potential of animation to allow emotional states to hae an impact
on the world through cartoon absurdism ! the animalism enables them to reveal
the primal instincts of humans

blind recreation to create images that are readable.
diane. sometimes, life is a bitch; then, you keep living.

* Do I need to go to university?
[[http://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/][article]]
it's hard to know who should take nontraditional paths, and many people are
looking for validation not to do so. realistically, this is the best option
for most people, both socially and academically.
Some questions:
- Do I have things that I deeply want to spend a year of my life exploring
  and working on?
- Do I have a way to support myself that leaves me time and energy to grow?
- Can I really work self-directed for months at a time? Do I have examples of
  me working hard on a personal project or learning without external
  structure?
- Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project
  independently?
- Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project
independently?
- Do I have sources of community, peer support or mentorship for what I want
  to do?

Those who leave university may be disparaging their efforts to make friends.
However, the ability to focus independently for an extended period of time
before heading to college is ideal for many people to flourish.

no skill called business
study micro, game theory, psych, persuasion, ethics, math and computers
reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching
too busy to do coffee but uncluttered calendar
enforce aspirational hourly rate, outsource if it makes sense
work as hard as you can. even though who you work with and what you work on are more important
become the best at what you do. keep redefining what you do until this is true.
there are no grq schemes
apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually you will get what you deserve
