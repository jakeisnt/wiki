#+TITLE: Gemini

HTTP is a bloated protocol.
Any visit to the website of a large company will tell you this.
Significant sizes of applications (often over 5 megabytes!), load times, and the constant
reminder to consent to cookies are all emblematic of what our internet has
become -- a service hostile to its users for the sake of profit.
Practically every website you visit tracks your information to collect both analytics and
personal data, assembling a profile of you that can be sold to advertisers,
government agencies and whoever else wants a cut of your data.

Gemini is a new protocol for browsing the internet founded by solderpunk.
it's designed only to serve data, and intends to foster a friendlier internet
-- one in which arbitrary information can't be passed from consumer to producer no
matter what the motivation.

Gemini can be thought of as the HTTPS equivalent of Gopher: all traffic is secured and encrypted.

I hope to have this wiki, along with my other personal websites, up on Gemini soon. All it takes is a program to convert org-mode files to files in a Gemini framework rather than a Hugo blog.

has special consideration for serving lightweight format

privacy! the internet is not a safe place for plaintext.
generality!

tls ? gopher can be written from scratch! but gopher still depends on ip
stack, dns resolver and filesystem. using tls for cryptography is necessary.
tls limits access to more modern machines, but it makes no sense to sacrifice
all privacy protections to accomodate them.

stunnel and xinetd for gemini. gemini is a great content oriented portable
