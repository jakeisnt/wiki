#+TITLE: Machine Learning

Tools for learning machine learning.
Obviously, this will expand into many files once I've developed more knowledge.

* Papers
https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net salient object detection
https://github.com/pliang279/awesome-multimodal-ml reading about multimodal ml
* Tutorials
https://github.com/fzenke/spytorch gradient learning for spiking neural networks
* Utilities
https://github.com/joseph-zhong/LipReading yes
https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa ml framework for automating text conversations

* ETC
