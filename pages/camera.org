Notes about cameras.

* Configuration
I've sold all of my Canon DSLR gear to downgrade to a lighter setup.
I'm now using a Fujifilm X-T3 with the 23mm f2 and 35mm f2 weather resistant lenses.

i made some progress on this; added the kernel module and got that working, but it's not clear whether i was using gphoto2 properly. revisit!
