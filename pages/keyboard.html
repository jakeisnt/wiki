<ul>
<li>on this layer remap shift so that it opens capital greek letter reevaluate how i use modifier keys and where i put my thumbs for ease of access</li>
</ul>
<p>what else do i type frequently? what is the fastest way to lay out the numpad to enable quick access? what function keys or macros would be useful to me? emojis?? on my keyboard?? introduce leader keys and macros to spit out some keyboard shortcuts, music, or important information explicitly document this somewhere dont be afraid to draw out specific layout!! <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2206-planck">https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2206-planck</a> this is very good thread with sdothum keyboard layou <a href="http://thedarnedestthing.com/colophon">http://thedarnedestthing.com/colophon</a> – god keyboard configuration layout and blog i love the Major Mono Display font! try to make some web dev project with thi <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/">http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/</a> – unique perspective on designing and creating a keyboard to prevent carpal tunnel problems from occuring with a keyboard configuration and layout obviously best action to take is planck or split keyboard, but the next action to take is changing the keyboard layout to radically change the way the fingers move as we type! do not place constraint on how many keys are relocated places on this site layout the q**lw* layouts for optimizing for various things, one keeps zxcv in place for greater effeffectiveness. consider using one of these as opposed to colemak or somethign for better effectivenes in geneeral: find what isnt working and optimiz potential ideas- macros for different latex expressions(it is possible that org mode already offers this)it may be better to just use org mode for latex and shortcut the org mode expressionsthis should be some 'math mode' laye- midi control layer- offers potential for drum kit as well as for a piano roll of some sort- perhaps dual buttons for tweaking knobs up and down- mappings similar to launchpad to programs such as abletonhttps://github.com/theniceboy/nviif i use colemak i will probably have to make some changes to other keybindings to reflect thicurrent are proper for qwerty but these ssame binds will not make sense in other placesfrom planck repos- ajp10304hold tab for shifthold enter for shifthold space for some function laye macros:</p>

<li>use beakl layout for thumb clusters</li>
<li>use the modified colemak variant for the qwerty keys</li>
