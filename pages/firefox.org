#+TITLE: Firefox

A great browser that deserves to be supported - because Rust exists and because Chrome doesn't deserve a monopoly.

** Vimium
Solid with basic Vim commands. I've used it for a long time.
** Tridactyl
Command palette and more! Trying this one out. Looks super configurable but I have yet to do so.
** Surfingkeys
Vimium + more shortcuts and built in editor. Hate the history navigation though.
