#+title: EXWM
[[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] is an [[file:./emacs.org][Emacs]] window manager.

It's a simple wrapper for X11 functions that allows for the user to interface primarily with Emacs.

It features workspaces, multimonitor support,
i3-like keybindings, and works practically out of the box!

It'll manage your external programs in native Emacs buffers as well.

Unfortunately, as a result of the browser oligopoly, it's not feasible to access many resources on the internet without a modern browser, so I'm making use of a
[[https://github.com/walseb/exwm-firefox-evil][Firefox compatibility layer]] to allow for the use of Firefox's keybindings through Emacs.

My configuration can be found [[https://github.com/jakechv/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm][here]].

Thankfully, even if I'm not using EXWM, Emacs just displays an error that 'another X window manager is running' when the EXWM configuration is loaded. It's no problem to keep
the configuration in my dotfiles even when I'm using bspwm or another window manager.

As I make more extensive use of org-mode, I find myself using fewer and fewer tools outside of Emacs. I've found that the tools I do use often have Emacs plugins that allow them to be used as
Emacs functions as well.

Really, Emacs (and EXWM) are partial solutions to a more systemic issue -- the way in which the Unix philosophy has lost its way on the modern Linux system.
