* web hostility
[[https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/][article]]
"Facebook is at odds with the open web that I love and defend..."
Netscape Navigator (small internet) -> big internet!
The modern web is being destroyed -- personalized content, growth hacking,
social media activation, CMS and user experience. These websites are not
built to appreciate the visitor -- they are constructed to make the user a
customer. Cookies bad! Small blogging good!
