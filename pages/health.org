* The strength of being misunderstood
https://blog.samaltman.com/
The most impressive people care a lot about what others think - anyone - but they only care on a long time horizon, as so long as the history books get it right the work is justified.

Trade short term status for long term; most people are unwilling to do this, but it's a sactifice worth making to become successful.

As Mike said: pick up the camera, put down social media, and work for 10 years. Become an expert. Only then can you come out and show your talent to everyone; you'll be most successful that wa; you'll be most successful that way.

"You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, "Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.""
—Rapoport's First Rule

"How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely."
—Kevin Kelly

"Kings speak for the realm, governors for the state, popes for the church. Indeed, the titled, as titled, cannot speak with annyone."
