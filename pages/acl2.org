#+TITLE: ACL2

ACL2 is a [[file:theoremprover.org][theorem prover]] based on Common Lisp commonly used for the verification of hardware.

[[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/index-seo.php/ACL2____TOP?path=3486][The wiki]] is an excellent source of information on the language.
[[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236578406_Verified_AIG_Algorithms_in_ACL2][This work]] discusses the verification of AIG graph representations of boolean functions.
[[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-programming-exercises1.html][This page]] has good programming exercises for ACL2.

Often used in [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]] with [[http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/htmlshow.php?title=Proof+General+user+manual&file=releases%2FProofGeneral%2Fdoc%2FProofGeneral%2FProofGeneral_2.html][Proof General]].

[[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-books/car/][Computer Aided Reasoning]], the textbook out of UT, is likely worth spending time reading as well.

[[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pete/courses/Computer-Aided-Reasoning/2018-Fall/][Pete's site for Computer-Aided Reasoning]]: lots of good resources for ACL2/S and working with the technology. Add his setup - or some modification of it - to your emacs configuration as a module!
