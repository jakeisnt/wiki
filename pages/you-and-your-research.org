* You and your research notes

- ``There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds that people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot think.''
- Shannon information theory?
- Hired as a clerk for the computers of people like Feynman and Shannon. Kept asking 'why?'
- you must first tell yourself that you'd like to do something significant
- there is always repitition we see in people who make impacts, like Shannon. Partly luck but the only control we have over that is our circumstances
- great work is not just 'brains'; often the issue is with articulation, a lack of an ability to access the language and forum necessary to develop ideas
- once you've developed the courage to face - and solve - important problems, you can - he postulates that this will lead to a stream of successes if you stick to the method
- the best stem work is often done early in the career while the best literary work is often done late
- do not define your scale by the problems you've faced, Shannon error


* Research times from @random_walker
Knowing lots of things isn't important.
What is important is:
- Knowing what you know and don't.
- Being good at teaching what you know.
- Admitting when you're incorrect.
- Communicating uncertainty effectively.
- Spotting bullshit.
- Recognizing others with expertise.
- Recognizing different domains of expertise.
- Recognizing different kinds of expertise.
- Drawing from the expertise of others without deferring to authourity.
- Accepting the unknowable. Abstractions exist for a reason!
