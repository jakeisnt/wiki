#+TITLE: Git

Git is a popular version control system.

* Tricks

* Writing a Git Commit Message
[[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][Article Reference]]

- Concise and consistent length and form
- Communicate clear context about a change to fellow developers.
  Ensure that other developers understand *why* a change was made.
** Rules
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
  if the body is to be used.
- Limit subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize subject line
- Do not end with period
- Use imperative mood; I 'do' this.
  Rationale: If applied, the commit will change these aspects of the code.
  Git's own built-in conventions use this form.
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain 'what' and 'why' as necessary

* Repositories
- GitHub :: I use this; Microsoft is bad but the community is good
- Sourcehut :: Minimal free software repository. I would use this if the developer weren't an egotistical BDFL.
- Gitea :: Open source git repository; self host it

* Organization Thoughts
github organization:
- one repo per course - as most courses require partner work
= repo for coding challenge practice problems
- managing research notes: ??? i am thinking a single org file for all of this
- - that is, an org file in each project for the research notes pertaining to that project,
- - and anotherorg file for misc. research ?? i will have to see how my research is used

* Rewriting
It's a good idea to reformat commits to make them more readable.
#+begin_src sh
git reset HEAD~${number of commits to go back}
#+end_src

** Patch previous commits with rebases
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9103396/how-do-i-edit-a-previous-git-commit
If you need to change commit history:
- Make another commit to make the change
- Rebase starting at the commit you want to change
- Squash the new commit with the old one in the history
- Remove the second commit message (or merge it...)
This did change the commit time for my latest commit, which is something to watch out for.

* Worktrees
- A git repository can have multiple working trees - allowing you to check out more than one workspace at a time!
  + Among other things, this allows you to work on multiple branches at once without having multiple copies of the file, and maps git branches or tags to other directories on your system. Use it to check on different efforts on projects without messing up your current editing environment - to look at code from other branches locally and simultaneously, for example!
- `git worktree add $PATH` :: Adds a new branch with a name associated with the final component of $PATH. `git worktree remove` and `git worktree prune` both allow you to cut off external worktrees.
- Flow example: latest develop, latest branch of work, and a third for reviewing pull requests and/or the work from other developers.
