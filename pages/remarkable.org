[[https://github.com/Evidlo/remarkable_syncthing][Syncthing for Remarkable]]  - this does not work, as remarkable uses a (remarkably, haha) unconventional format for tracking items and changes in order to cache some information. i need to write my own tool to convert between a sane format and the remarkable's proprietary one (perhaps i can store some info in pdf metadata for caching and access it on the remarkable side?).
