#+TITLE: Wiki

Wikis are tree-based tools for representing
hierarchies of information.

This personal wiki is the one I maintain.
Others refer to personal wikis as /Digital Gardens/,
/Brain Dumps/, or /Personal Libraries/.

The source of this wiki can be found at [[https://github.com/jakeisnt/wiki]].

* Motivation
** Organization
I needed a way to better organize my ideas.
Administering structure to my data was a good way
to do this, and org-mode provides a good facility for this.
Further, the constraints administered by the website motivate me to better organize my notes as they're visible to the public; without this structure the notes won't even render properly.

** Accessibility
I'd like my notes to be easily visible to anyone.
It allows me to easily share my thoughts and perspectives with friends or colleagues.

** Publicity
This portal also enables recruiters or future collaborators to learn more about me, my skills and my interests. Perhaps I can build a following, inspire someone, or find an interesting job opportunity if someone stumbles upon this wiki.
* Ideas
- https://years.cblgh.org/ Briefly summarize what you've done each month and year! This is excellent for reflection, learning and growth. It can be easily contrasted with goals. I think that doing this on a monthly basis would be much more helpful than yearly; perhaps I could introduce some tags to the wiki that would help catalogue this.
- https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/ :: Add a personal canon; catalogue the things that have had the most impact on you. This could be difficult but it's worth goingthrough the effort! Would be great to do some justice to each thing that's inspired you.
- https://phse.net/values/ :: Cataloguing a list of values on the website seems incredibly value for myself or for others. These ideas are definitely admirable. (Making connections with other people has a higher return than making good work, it seems!)
* Design
- tags :: [[file:web_design.org][Web Design]],[[file:design.org][Design]]
The design of this wiki has gone through multiple phases.

I started with a Hugo template, adding browsing features in multiple panes to the site, but Hugo proved to be too complex of a tool to sustainably use in the long term.

The current iteration of this site is generated with a Pandoc-based tool I've written myself, as I felt I wanted more customizability. Eventually, I'd like to generate multiple front-ends for the website -- so that visitors can view it as a wiki, as a traditional blog, a series of journals, or something in between -- depending on how they view the website.

* References
I've taken inspiration from several others who maintain wikis.
- [[https://github.com/tommy-mor][Tommy Morriss]] first introduced me to the idea with his personal (private) wiki.
- [[https://jethro.dev][Jethro]] has easily accessible articles and templates that I've made use of to put this together.
- [[https://100r.co][100 Rabbits]] publish all of their notes and information in a custom wiki framework.
  [[https://github.com/logseq/logseq][Logseq]] is a really cool tool for maintaining a personal knowledge basin that syncs effortlessly with GitHub.

- https://royniang.com/ has an excellent wiki with a ton of great ideas. Good style! Worth linking [[file:personal-website.org][Personal Websites]].
- [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/][Stanford's psychology wiki]] is detailed and easy to navigate.
- [[https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog][Frank McSherry's blog]] is maintained entirely by .md files in a journal with a simple markdown index. Git *is* the UI.
  https://twtxt.net/ is an interesting microblogging platform
- https://codeberg.org/Valenoern/bopwiki :: a small wiki implemented entirely in a DSL that's been written in common lisp!
- https://blot.im/ :: blog with your favorite text editor, publish to the service. Basically a static site generator?
- https://azlen.me/ is an excellent second brain. They're an admirable writer with loads worth following.

* Notes
https://jlelse.blog/posts/wiki-approach/ cool wiki approach :: find the best method for me ! I think writing a blog post is the best way to help me organize my thoughts, i should get that infrastructure up. nextcloud notes is also a good option, but i do have to set up a nextcloud server to handle that

- site map!
- related tags!
- backlinks!
- resoures!
- activity graph for research or projects!
  i love how this wiki looks and feels
  uses [[https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/][PARA]] method of organizing information
  and a feed! god this shit is so good
  and a table of contents but everything is hidden out of the way! IBM plex mono is /almost/ there - but not quite
  
[[https://web.hypothes.is/][hypothesis]]: a margin with conversations anywhere on the web! i cannot stress how cool this is, particularly the trick with the sidebar
https://dreamwiki.sixey.es/welcome.dream/
http://mindforger.com/: markdown-powered wiki software
* concrete plan
learn to build small software! a wiki is the best way to do this.
- write a basic org-mode parser in ANSI [[file:cpp.org][C and C++]]
  supports links, `#+title`, nested bullets, etc. fairly simple to start.
- with inspiration from devine's wiki, integrate this parser into a service
  that parses things out to html, also written in ANSI C
- continue to rewrite in rust and other languages, like zig perhaps, for fun and to learn more programming
- experiment with a file format other than org under the hood; something with an equivalent level
  of expression but much simpler [i don't use most of the features of org here anyways; org feels like it's
  doing too much as a file format, and i use different subsets of the format in different ways]
  - would be cool to use a babel-adjacent technology to be able to convert to file formats compatible with other platforms on the fly.
** experiments
- figure out the best way to do project management. learn more about the mailing list strategy adn see how that compares to a `TODO.org` approach that I've been using in a few of my projects to take notes and ideas.
- build hyper specific tools to interact with my wiki in different ways to enforce certain ways of integrating with it: adding a new idea, journal entry, or something similar for example. emacs is a nice interface and should be worked on, but it shouldn't be the only one. small, portable `.sh` scripts could be fun to experiment with here.
