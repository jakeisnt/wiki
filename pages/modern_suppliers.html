<li>leverage software to lower barrier to entry</li>
<li>provide tooling too difficult and resource intensive for in house work</li>
<li>align incentives with customers; i.e. pay per use enabling scaling. api, saas, business in a box, etc… AWS is a huge deal in this space - with it companies have no need to worry about their own server infrastructures!</li>
</ul>
<p>given the right business model, you grow directly alongside your consumer; i.e. twilio supports whatsapp substantially and considerably. stripe is probably the best example of this! all you have to do to accept payments is dispatch to strip : )</p>

<li>supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery</li>
<li>supposing that heat comes from the furnace</li>
</ul>
<p>you can build these in house, eventually!</p>
<p>becoming a good theoretical computer science:</p>
<ul>
<li>theoretical fields are so important to practical advancements</li>
<li>math and physics are vital to pursuing any theoretical field</li>
</ul>
<p>to become a good computer science researcher, study math. you will always have time to switch to the 'practical side of the force', but it's worth spending time to hone engineering</p>
<p>turing machines and the halting problem. the Entscheindunsproblem created the turing machine and the turing test – determined that the mathematics are decidable, evaluating a definite procedure to show if a math statement is true or false the question prompted an answer: the turing machine!</p>
<p>Mathematical THeory of communication set the foundation for telecommunications - but in and of itself is not! Shannon's information theory of entropy takes thermodynamic entropy and transforms it to impact communications</p>
<p>shannon theorem, shannon-hartley theorem the class mip* of languages cna be decided by a verifier is equal to RE, recursively enumerable languages! read more, @adlarocha</p></body></html>
