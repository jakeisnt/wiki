#+TITLE: Window Management

Window managers are programs that allow a user to interface with their computer.
I currently use the [[file:../tools/exwm.org][EXWM]] window manager, but I've used [[file:../tools/bspwm.org][Bspwm]], i3 and herbstluftwm in the past.
On MacOS and Windows, this is your standard user interface, just as it is with Gnome or another desktop management service in Linux.
