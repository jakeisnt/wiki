<p>It's a simple wrapper for X11 functions that allows for the user to interface primarily with Emacs.</p>
<p>It features workspaces, multimonitor support, i3-like keybindings, and works practically out of the box!</p>
<p>It'll manage your external programs in native Emacs buffers as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as a result of the browser oligopoly, it's not feasible to access many resources on the internet without a modern browser, so I'm making use of a <a href="https://github.com/walseb/exwm-firefox-evil">Firefox compatibility layer</a> to allow for the use of Firefox's keybindings through Emacs.</p>
<p>My configuration can be found <a href="https://github.com/jakechv/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.doom.d/modules/desktop/exwm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, even if I'm not using EXWM, Emacs just displays an error that 'another X window manager is running' when the EXWM configuration is loaded. It's no problem to keep the configuration in my dotfiles even when I'm using bspwm or another window manager.</p>
<p>As I make more extensive use of org-mode, I find myself using fewer and fewer tools outside of Emacs. I've found that the tools I do use often have Emacs plugins that allow them to be used as Emacs functions as well.</p>
<p>Really, Emacs (and EXWM) are partial solutions to a more systemic issue â€“ the way in which the Unix philosophy has lost its way on the modern Linux system.</p>
