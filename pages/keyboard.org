** what do I want my keyboard to do?
 - type, well
 - preserve some similarity to my laptop keyboard
 - make it easy to do the things i can do in i3 on laptop already
 - midi layer to play notes and make music !!

** rough ideas
greek letters behind a hidden layer for fast math typing
- on this layer remap shift so that it opens capital greek letter
  reevaluate how i use modifier keys and where i put my thumbs for ease of access
what else do i type frequently?
what is the fastest way to lay out the numpad to enable quick access?
what function keys or macros would be useful to me?
emojis?? on my keyboard??
  introduce leader keys and macros to spit out some keyboard shortcuts,
music, or important information
explicitly document this somewhere
dont be afraid to draw out specific layout!!

obviously best action to take is planck or split keyboard, but the next action
to take is changing the keyboard layout to radically change the way the
fingers move as we type!
do not place constraint on how many keys are relocated
places on this site layout the q**lw* layouts for optimizing for various things,
one keeps zxcv in place for greater effeffectiveness. consider using one of
these as opposed to colemak or somethign for better effectivenes

potential ideas- macros for different latex expressions(it is possible that org
mode already offers this)it may be better to just use org mode for latex and
shortcut the org mode expressionsthis should be some 'math mode' laye- midi
control layer- offers potential for drum kit as well as for a piano roll of some
sort- perhaps dual buttons for tweaking knobs up and down- mappings similar to
launchpad to programs such as abletonhttps://github.com/theniceboy/nviif i use
colemak i will probably have to make some changes to other keybindings to
reflect thicurrent are proper for qwerty but these ssame binds will not make
sense in other placesfrom planck repos- ajp10304hold tab for shifthold enter for

- this would have macros specific to the navigation of tmux
- kc lead to find key combos not concurrent

general plan:
- use beakl layout for thumb clusters
- use the modified colemak variant for the qwerty keys
- think hard about how to arrange the alternate layers

one is relative to the
