#+title: Vim

Vim is a text editor with an easily configurable extension language. It's most frequently used as a [[file:./terminal_ui.org][TUI]] program but also has an (aft-used) graphical application distribution (Gvim).

I've come to prefer the power of [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]] but I do miss Vim's performance.

However, it has a first-class editor-based extension language that's written to prioritize text processing and configuration. Its extensive, literate keybindings that have made their way into every popular text editor as well as many other applications.

It's one of best text-editing tools in the Unix ecosystem, and Vim users often have a library of cli and tui programs that they use in conjunction with Vim to facilitate a desktop ecosystem without a GUI.

Vim is often preinstalled on Unix systems. If it's unavailable, such systems will likely still have vi (or busybox vi), so taking the time to learn vim keybindings is worthwhile for their flexibility throughout programming environments.

* Shortcut Optimisations
** Leader keys
- Comma :: As it should always be followed with a space grammatically, every other key can be freely mapped to with no delay! You lose the functionality of backwards repeating though...
- Space :: What doom emacs uses, my current key and what I'm used to. This works fine, but the timeout definitely can impact the fluency of writing on occasion.
- Semicolon :: Interesting option, but there seem to be some strange repeat patterns in specific modes.
- \ :: Controversial, it's pretty far away... but it's the default. Unclear whether bashing the pinkie to the right is a great motion (just like Emacs and the left).

* Lua plugins and config
I don't think lua is ready for NixOS yet - it seems to have some trouble finding plugins for the Lua path - but it's worth considering for the future.
- feline.nvim :: A good status line for NeoVim with Lua, much faster than status quo.
