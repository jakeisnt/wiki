** Baked Chicken Parmesean

Sauce:
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled, finely chopped (about 2 teaspoons)
1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes (we use Muir-Glen)
1/2 teaspoon dried basil (or 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh basil)
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano (or 1 teaspoon of chopped fresh oregano)
1/4 teaspoon sugar
Salt and ground black pepper to taste

Chicken:
3 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1 Tbsp white-wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 pounds chicken breast cutlets (or skinless boneless chicken breasts or
thighs that have been pounded to a 1/4-inch thickness)
1 cup of breadcrumbs (panko or homemade)
1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted

1 Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan on medium high heat.
Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Stir in the crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, sugar, a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer.

Continue to simmer until sauce thickens a bit and flavors meld, about 10-12 minutes. Taste sauce, adjust seasoning if necessary, cover and keep warm.

2 Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with foil, parchment, or Silpat. While the sauce is simmering, prepare the chicken in the next steps.

3 Make the coating: In a large bowl whisk together the mustard, vinegar, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.

Add the chicken cutlets to the mixture and coat well on both sides.

4 Dredge the chicken: In another bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Mix well and stir in the melted butter. Transfer to a shallow plate.

Dredge the chicken pieces in the breadcrumb mixture, gently pressing the breadcrumbs into the chicken cutlets. Place dredged chicken on the lined baking sheet.

5 Bake: Bake at 450°F on the center rack of the oven until cooked and golden
brown, about 15 minutes.

6 Serve: Serve with a side of rice, noodles or pasta. Ladle sauce with the chicken.
