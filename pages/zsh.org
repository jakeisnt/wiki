#+TITLE: Zsh

Zsh, z-shell is a more flexible and configurable shell.
It offers an enhanced scripting language,
greated configurability and pluggability over the standard
shell while still implementing both the POSIX standard and conventions
used with bash, dash and sh (as the POSIX standard is unfortunately far from complete).
